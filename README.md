=========

Going back to the basics of web design -- 
things I learned a millennia ago in order to pick up new tips and tricks.

I am completing the HTML Fundamentals tutorial to really make sure that 
I have a strong understanding of HTML 5 elements.

I am using Git in order to organize and to track the changes being made,
but also to give me practice on using git from terminal. So there will be 
more commits than necessary as I practice using git from Terminal.

Tutorials can be found on Lynda.com - HTML Fundamentals.
